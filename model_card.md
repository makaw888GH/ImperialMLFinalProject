# Model Card

## Model Description

**Input:** Describe the inputs of your model
* 21 features and 1 label were used as input for model training and testing
* Features were normalised and converted to weight of evidence as inputs to the model to improve performance

**Output:** Describe the output(s) of your model
* The primary output of the model is to predict the probability of credit card payment default
* Other output of the model as part of the exploratory data analysis includes: Information Value, Population Stability Index (Data Drift analysis), Weight of Evidence, and Feature Importance

**Model Architecture:** Describe the model architecture youâ€™ve used
* Logistic Regression Model architecture from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
* * Bayesian Optimisation BayesSearchCV used for hyperparameter optimisation

## Limitations

### Multicollinearity:
* Logistic regression requires moderate or no multicollinearity between independent variables. High correlation between predictors can lead to unstable model estimates. This issue has been mitigated by removing features which exceed correlation threshold
### Outperformed by More Complex Algorithms:
* While logistic regression is useful for simple datasets, more powerful algorithms like neural networks can often outperform it.
### Regularization for Overfitting:
In high-dimensional datasets, logistic regression may overfit. Regularization techniques (such as L1 or L2 regularization) can help mitigate this issue.

## Trade-offs

A loss function could be introduced to optimise False Positive and False Negative, dependent on risk appetite of the business.
